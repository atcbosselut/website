<h2> About </h2>
<p>
I am a second year PhD student at the University of Washington working in the <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp>UW Natural Language Processing Group</a> and the <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/ml> Machine Learning Group</a>.  I am currently advised by <a target="_blank" href=http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin>Yejin Choi</a>. My research focuses on integrating natural language corpora and image data into multimodal models capable of providing a deeper understanding of both fields by leveraging the advantages of both sources of data. My current projects include event modeling in photo albums using the images, their captions, and their time stamps; recognition of spatial characteristics in captioned images; and identifying semantic correspondences between radiology reports and images. If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to shoot me an e-mail.

<p>
Prior to joining the University of Washington, I received a B.Eng. in Honours Electrical Engineering with a minor in Finance from McGill University in Montreal. During my time there, I had the pleasure of working with <a target="_blank" href=http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~ipsaro1/>Ioannis Psaromiligkos</a>, with whom I completed an honours thesis on using signal processing filters to reduce realized risk in financial equity portfolios. I was a proud recipient of the Alma Mater Scholarship, the Motorola Foundation Scholarship, the Brodeur-Drummond Scholarship, and the Brian Cullen Memorial Award.

<p>
During my summers, prior to joining the UW, I completed internships with the National Institutes of Health under the supervision <a target="_blank" href=http://irp.nih.gov/pi/john-oshea>Dr. John O'Shea</a> and <a target="_blank" href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SnxdkWMAAAAJ&hl=en>Dr. Golnaz Vahedi</a> and at Morgan Stanley as a Technology Analyst.
